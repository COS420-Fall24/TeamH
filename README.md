## Problem Statements
#### These are tentative

### Problem Statement 1: Difficulty Finding Common Times with Large Groups
-When coordinating with groups of 10 or more people, it is often difficult to find common times when everyone is able to attend.
-For example, organizing meetings or social events with groups of 10 or more people often leads to endless back-and-forth communication as people struggle to schedule meetings that everyone is able to attend and contribute. Due to conflicting work, personal, or other commitments, groups often end up with people being forced to commit to a designated time weeks in advance.
-Some calendar applications and scheduling tools like When2meet attempt to mitigate this by allowing people to indicate their availability for others to see.
- But these solutions only provide basic polling that doesn’t show actual commitment levels real-time. These tools don’t account for last-minute schedule changes or integrate with different types of calendars and scheduling platforms, leading to inefficiency and missed opportunities for optimal scheduling.
-How can we design a scheduling system that integrates across personal calendars and adapts dynamically to group members' changing availability, making it easier to find common times in large groups?

### Problem Statement 2: Data Loss When Switching Music Streaming Platforms
-When users switch between music streaming platforms, their playlists and music libraries do not sync, causing loss of carefully curated content and a frustrating experience.
-For example, a user who switches from Spotify to Apple Music has to recreate their playlists manually. Even though the songs may exist on both platforms, users lose the time and effort spent curating their libraries, and some songs might not be available on both services.
-Some third-party services, like Soundiiz and TuneMyMusic, allow users to transfer playlists between platforms. These services often address the surface problem of moving playlists, for example by converting playlists from one format to another.
-However, these solutions don’t consistently handle discrepancies between platform catalogs, leading to missing songs or broken playlists. Moreover, they require users to manually use an external tool every time they switch platforms, which is cumbersome and not integrated into the native user experience. Nor do these platforms offer automatic syncing.
-How can we design a seamless playlist and library syncing mechanism that addresses cross-platform compatibility, allowing users to retain their musical experience across different streaming services?

### Problem Statement 3: Adding Notes to Calendar with Time Slots is Inefficient
-It’s not possible to add meetings with time slots from a notes phone application directly into their calendar.
-For example, a user has to memorize the time and subject in order to transfer their schedule from their notes application into their calendar.
- There are some applications that combine both of these functionalities, where it is a calendar application that also has a note taking functionality.
-This solution doesn't fully address the need for quick and automatic conversion of notes into scheduled events, users are not able to have an application dedicated to writing down notes and another application dedicated to being a calendar planner.
-How can we design a system that allows the user to automatically take their notes and adds them to a user’s calendar with appropriate time slots, reducing the need for manual input and multiple steps?
