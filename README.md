### Quick Start

#### Install
Step 1: Open Terminal \
Step 2: Run `cd nocom` in terminal to position yourself in the FrontEnd folder \
Step 3: Run `npm install`

This will install all the packages and their dependencies used by the app. You need to complete this before building, running or testing the app.


#### Build 
Step 1: Open Terminal \
Step 2: Run `cd nocom` in terminal to position yourself in the app folder \
Step 3: Run `npm run build` 

#### Run application
Step 1: Open Terminal \
Step 2: Run `cd nocom` in terminal to position yourself in the app folder \
Step 3: Run `npm start` or `npm run start` 

A browser window should open automatically. If no browser window opens, open one manually and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

#### Run unit tests
Step 1: Open Terminal \
Step 2: Run `cd nocom` in terminal to position yourself in the app folder \
Step 3: Run `npm run test`

## Mission Statement
Helping beginner programmers learn to read code.

## Problem Statement

Many beginner programmers struggle to read and understand code, which limits their ability to progress in learning programming languages and solving complex problems.

For example, novice programmers often find it challenging to understand the logic and structure of even simple code snippets. This confusion can stem from unfamiliar syntax, poorly commented code, or difficulty in grasping the relationships between different parts of the code. As a result, beginners frequently become discouraged and may abandon learning programming altogether.

Existing solutions such as online tutorials and coding platforms often focus on writing code from scratch or solving programming challenges, but they do not emphasize code reading skills. Some coding platforms provide examples, but they lack interactive tools that explain code line-by-line or break down concepts in a way that is accessible for beginners.

While current platforms help beginners practice coding, they don’t provide enough focus on teaching how to read and interpret existing code effectively. This gap leaves new programmers struggling to understand the foundational building blocks of coding, preventing them from developing strong problem-solving skills and confidence.

How can we design an interactive platform or program that teaches beginner programmers how to read and interpret code efficiently, providing real-time feedback and clear explanations on the functionality of the code as well as explanations for the syntax errors of the code which will enhance their learning process?
